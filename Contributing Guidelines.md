## Steps to contribute to this awesome project:

You can contribute by solving any of the 450 problems from the sheet in any language and then raising a pull request.

1. Fork this repository
2. You basically need to add the files at the repective languages folder of a problem
	i. for example if you want to add the java solution for ["Count Inversion"](https://github.com/draco-malfoy/DCS-LoveBabbar/tree/main/Database/Arrays/Count%20Inversion) problem, then add the java solution to the [java folder](https://github.com/draco-malfoy/DCS-LoveBabbar/tree/main/Database/Arrays/Count%20Inversion/Java) inside Count Inversion.
3. If the folder doesn't already have a solution, then delete the placeholder file called ["delete.txt"](https://github.com/draco-malfoy/DCS-LoveBabbar/blob/main/Database/Arrays/Count%20Inversion/Java/delete.txt) and place your solution 
named as "01.cpp" or "01.java" etc.
4. Else if the folder has one or many solutions already present, then place your file named after the last numbered solution. Like if the last solution is "14.java", create your file as "15.java"
5. Finally update this number in the ["readme"](https://github.com/draco-malfoy/DCS-LoveBabbar/blob/main/README.md) file at the repective problems row.
